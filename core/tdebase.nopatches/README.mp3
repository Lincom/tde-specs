# mp3 support for Konqueror
#

Konqueror provides a module to read raw data from audio CD's.
You can see the contents of an audio CD by entering "audiocd:/" as the URL.
Ogg Vorbis or Wave format files can be generated by drag and drop with
a standard SuSE installation.

Konqueror also supports generating mp3 files using the lame encoder, which is not 
shipped with SUSE Linux for legal reasons.

MP3 technology is patented by Fraunhofer and THOMSON multimedia and possibly
others.  For full legal coverage, a patent license, a software license, an
electronic music distribution license and possibly additional licenses may be
needed.
http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/index.html indicates that some of these
licenses are free for non-commercial use.

Technically, it is sufficient to install the package 'lame' to enable mp3
compression in konqueror. The installation procedure for lame is straight 
forward as with any other RPM package. Using the lame.spec file from 
this directory guarantees smooth integration into your SUSE Linux system.

Here is a short HOW-TO:

 1. get lame 3.91.3 (older versions are not support, newer may work) from
    ftp://lame.sourceforge.net/pub/lame/src/

 2. copy lame-3.91.3.tar.gz into /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/

 3. build a rpm using the lame.spec file from this directory by calling
    rpm -ba lame.spec

 4. install the rpm by calling
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/packages/RPMS/i386/lame-*.rpm
 
 5. restart KDE, afterwards a directory "MP3" should exist in konqueror
    after entering the "audiocd:/" URL.

 6. The Encoder you just built is subject to at least the 'patent-only license', as 
    detailled in http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/software.html


Have a lot of fun

Your SuSE Team.
