+description.qt3
Qt is a program library for developing applications with graphical user
interfaces. It allows you to rapidly develop professional programs. The
Qt library is available not only for Linux but for a great number of
Unices and even for Windows. Thus it is possible to write programs that
may be easily ported to those platforms.

You need a license for using Qt with a non-GPL application, which can
be acquired from sales@trolltech.com.

See /usr/share/doc/packages/qt3 for details about the new features of
the current Qt library!
